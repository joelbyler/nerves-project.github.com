## Nervous System - Nerves Clustering Using Your Own Distribution

Timmo Verlaan's presentation at ElixirConf.EU 2017.

Coming with Erlang R19 is the option to use your own distribution module. This creates the possibility for having auto-connecting Nerves devices without worrying about the local network or specifying node names upfront. In this talk I will explore the different solutions up until now. One of which was my first go at creating "distributed blinky" (having a led blink on 2+ devices taking turns). Then I will take a look at how we can create our own distribution module and see how we can leverage that so we don't need any upfront knowledge about node names and are independent of the local network. Our goal is to create an autonomously connecting Nerves cluster with zero effort! But, can it be done?

## Fly like an Eagle

Loic Vigneron's presentation at ElixirConf.EU 2017.

It is the story of the birth of a quadcopter built using a 3D printer, a Raspberry Pi 3 and some Elixir magic. I will begin from the genesis of the project up to a flying drone. Expect some code, some hardware and some 3D printing time-lapse.

## Prototype to Production: Creating Connected Hardware with Nerves

Justin Schneck's presentation at Erlang & Elixir Factory SF 2017

Nerves is a powerful platform for creating and distributing embedded linux systems in Elixir and Erlang. Using Nerves, you can quickly create robust devices from a wide selection of off the shelf hardware and accessories. Rapid prototyping is a crucial phase in the development of any product. Together, we will explore the new features of Nerves and demonstrate how to quickly create and iterate using devices like Raspberry Pi. Finally, we will describe the process of moving from prototype to production and how to create distributable devices.

## Lonestar ElixirConf 2017 - Opening Keynote

Justin Schneck's Opening Keynote at Lonestar ElixirConf 2017.

Developing "hardware and hardware accessories" can be difficult and time consuming. Until now, you would have to constantly swap SD cards or create and push full firmware updates in order to iterate on your device. We want to make the development cycle as comfortable as possible by marrying the fundamentals of Erlang hot code reloading with connected Hardware in the Loop (HIL). Together, we will explore the Nerves development cycle through live demonstrations from mix nerves.new to mix firmware. Furthermore, we will push live code updates and even leverage the Phoenix Live Reloader on the Target. Finally, we will take a peek at executing ExUnit tests on connected hardware.

## Creating a Nerves-based Status Monitor (or how to sneak Elixir into your company)

Andrew Selder's presentation at Lonestar ElixirConf 2017.

Like many of you, the organization I work for is deeply invested in an ecosystem other than Elixir, in our case Rails. However, we have lots of engineers interested in Elixir. The question: how do we get the rest of the developers interested and convince the bosses that Elixir is a worthwhile technology to invest in?

In deciding what to do, we had to consider the potential impact to our service (the Boss really frowns on taking down the site and annoying paying customers), the scope of the project (the Boss frowns on developers disappearing for a month to play with cool shiny things), intriguing the other engineers (engineers like cool shiny things). Balancing all these concerns was the key in getting buy-in from everyone.

We decided to build a status monitoring device using Nerves that shows the high level health of our app at a glance. We have LED strips showing recent apdex scores for our app (via NewRelicâ€™s API), recent error rates (from Honeybadger), and the status of recent builds (from CircleCI), along with a big red flashing light for when Pingdom says our site is down.

For about $100 in parts, and a couple weekends of hacking, we built an appliance that was useful to the organization, showed off the power of Elixir/OTP, and was just darn cool!

## The Joy of Connecting Elixir to the Physical World

Frank Hunleth's presentation at Elixir & Phoenix Conf 2016.

With all of the Python, Node.js and C++ libraries for connecting to sensors, actuators, and other devices, it's easy to dismiss Elixir as a language for physical computing. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Between binary pattern matching, a functional approach to transforming low level data, and natural support for recovering from the hiccups of real world hardware, Elixir is an ideal language. The main parts missing have been low level library support.

This talk starts with a discussion of the options for connecting to hardware devices, challenges and pitfalls of each technique, and tips for minimizing frustration. It will provide an in depth-view of using the `nerves_uart` library, your laptop, and an inexpensive FTDI cable to interact with sensors, motors, smart phones via Bluetooth LE, and more. Each example will show how Elixir can beautify some really ugly hardware interfaces. Finally, the talk will end with how to remove the tether to your laptop by creating standalone embedded devices with Nerves.

## Nerves + Phoenix Saves a Father's Sanity!

Joel Byler's presentation at Elixir & Phoenix Conf 2016.

Recently I've been able to encourage my children to do their chores and not fight about it. Its been made possible with the help of Elixir and an Umbrella project which combines the use of Phoenix and Nerves (and some prototyping hardware) to build a chore system which rewards each kid with their own internet access after they've done their work for the day. It also makes it really easy to revoke access when they misbehave. In this talk I'll take you with me back through the journey, and I'll talk about why it was needed, what I learned, and how the the final outcome has saved my sanity.

## Building "learn to touch type" glove with Elixir and Arduino

Tetiana Dushenkivska's presentation at Elixir & Phoenix Conf 2016.

Knowledge-sharing about building "touch-typing glove" with Arduino and Elixir. This talk is about my journey from research, choosing tools, making flexible tiny pressure sensors, plugging them into Arduino, reading information from Arduino to the server running Elixir, and rendering result in the browser.

## Nerves: Connected beyond the Node
Justin Schneck's presentation at Elixir & Phoenix Conf 2016.

Nerves defines an entirely new way to build embedded systems with Elixir that is ready to revolutionize the industry. Embedded systems have never been easier to create using familiar tools and frameworks, and now we are making it even more connected. Together, we will explore new features in Nerves which make debugging your target even easier. Learn how to create stunning user interfaces for touchscreen displays using Phoenix. Perform ExUnit on your target device, and more. Join us to learn more about the exciting new features which makes Nerves a powerful and productive tool for creating amazing new products.

## Getting Started with Nerves
Frank Hunleth describes how to use `nerves-sdk` (now renamed to `nerves-system-br`) to build cross-compiled
firmware written in erlang.  While we are working to dramatically simplify this
process with our `bake` tool, this is a good overview of how nerves
can be used today in linux to cross-compile Erlang and Elixir code.
